I describe myself as a person who rely on todo list to orgainize work and life.

I'm used to using [the 4 quadrants of time management matrix](https://timeular.com/blog/time-management-matrix/) to make a todo list in my daily schedule. 

Every weekday morning, it's time to ask myself: What's the most important thing I need to get done today? What do I need to get done today? 
At the same time, I will also check my upcoming schedule in order to keep all of tasks in my control. 
Last but not least, I will focus on completing these tasks which were sorted based on priority before the deadline.
