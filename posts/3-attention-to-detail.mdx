We all know that attention to detail is important because it helps prevent mistakes and it makes success in the workplace easier.
There are various methods and techniques that you can apply to become better at paying attention to detail.


#### ___Get organized___
It makes sense that when everything is chaotic. So,the first step to take to improve your attention to detail at work is to get organized. 
For example, mark down appointments and meetings to ensure you won't forget about them.

#### ___Make a todo list___
Making a to do list allows you to prioritize and allocate time for every task. You become more focused on what you're doing.
My favorites todo list apps is Todoist which is a sleek app.

#### ___Limit distractions___
It's important that you turn off phone notifications; If you have an extension that pops up every time you get an email or other things, meanwhile, disable that.
Limit the time you spend checking your email and create a space that helps you relax and focus.

#### ___Take regular breaks___
Get up as often as you can, and walk around the office. Give your brain a break.Going back to work with a refreshed mind can make your brain more focused.
