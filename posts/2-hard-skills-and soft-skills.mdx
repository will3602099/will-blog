I am supposed to know the difference between hard skills and soft sills if I want to apply for my dream job.

Hard skills are job-specific and measureable abilities. Soft skills prove you'd be great fit anythere. 
Three hard skills examples are coding, designing, and architecture. 
Three soft skills examples are interpersonal skills, communication, and leadership.
And I need to show the right mix of both to get hired and prove them.
